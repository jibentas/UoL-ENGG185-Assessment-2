Statistics and Programming Assessment 2

This is a temporary storage space for my answer scripts to Assessment 2 of ENGG185 - Introduction to Statistics and Programming. It contains scripts to Q2 and Q4 of the Acceptance Sampling section of the assessment, which I find to be much nicer to view than pasting them in a google form, plus I can comment easily on my code as well.

If this needs to be taken down, please do send me a message and I will make the repository private as soon as possible.

Q2 - What Python code did you use to compute the answer to the question above? Use semicolons (;) to separate lines.
Q4 - Write a Python script to create a labeled graph showing how the probability of rejecting the lot rises as the value of "bad" increases from 0 to 150. What is your script? Use semicolons (;) to separate lines.
